# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
  * Fairly confident.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
  * I could probably use a little more practice,
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
  * Generally fairly confident, i had a minor issue with using = vs == in if_statements.rb
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
  * ~2 hours. It lined up pretty well, I thought it might take a little bit longer.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * The calendar is really tripping me up still because I'm not great at breaking up my hours with specific activities beyond doctors appointments and things that are already set in stone like class times.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * I had a lot of fun with decision_making.rb, and I would like to know how to make something like that interactive instead of requiring the variables to be placed in advance. I can google it, or see if it gets covered at some point. If it's not covered, asking an instructor is the next logical step.
